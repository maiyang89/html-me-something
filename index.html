					<br>One of my favorite things to do is create DIY crafts, such as Coffee Filter flowers as shown above.
					<br>That&apos;s right, these flowers were made from <em>Coffee Filters</em>.
					<br>The process involved in creating these flowers is quite simple. 
					<ol>
						<li>You take some 8-inch round coffee filters and dye them to the color of your liking.</li>
						<li>Once the filters have finished drying, you fold them together into fours and staple the center.</li>
						<li>Then, you turn them inside out and scrunch them together to form a flower.</li>
						<li>You can then decide to leave them as is or add stems to them to reflect actual flowers.</li>
						<li>And wah-lah! The end product can then be used to make a floral arrangement as shown above.</li>
					</ol>

				<h2>Bird Cages</h2>
				<article>
					<p>Bird Cages are one of my favorite items to decorate.</p>
				</article>
				<p>
					<img src="C:\Users\MYang\code\html-me-something\images\using-bird-cages-for-home-decor-beautiful-ideas-4-554x754.jpg">
					<br>This birdcage is beautifully decorated with pearls and flowers.  It adds a nice elegance to any baby shower or wedding deco&#769;r.
					<br>The nice thing about bird cages is that you can decorate them in any way you&apos;d like.
					<br>For instance, you can add butterflies and glitter, or soil and greenery.  Anything to match your specific party ideas.

				<h2>Balloons</h2>

					<br>Balloons are great to work with in any craft project.
					<br>They can be used in different projects to create anything you can dream of.
					<br>As seen in the picture above, balloons were formed to create a bottle.
					<br>This decoration was created for a friend's baby shower to indicate her little bundle of joy to come.

				<h2>Tablecloths</h2>
				<p>
					Tablecloths are a great item to use in party decorations.
					<br>They can be manipulated to create anything you desire.
					<br>You can use them during Halloween to create ghosts and spiders.
					<br>They can be draped to ceilings and posts to create a dramatic effect.
					<br>One of the main benefits to using tablecloths is that they are inexpensive yet effective.
