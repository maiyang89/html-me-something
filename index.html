						One of my favorite things to do is create DIY crafts, such as Coffee Filter flowers as shown above.
						That&apos;s right, these flowers were made from <em>Coffee Filters</em>.
						The process involved in creating these flowers is quite simple. 
					<ol>
						<li>You take some 8-inch round coffee filters and dye them to the color of your liking.</li>
						<li>Once the filters have finished drying, you fold them together into fours and staple the center.</li>
						<li>Then, you turn them inside out and scrunch them together to form a flower.</li>
						<li>You can then decide to leave them as is or add stems to them to reflect actual flowers.</li>
						<li>And wah-lah! The end product can then be used to make a floral arrangement as shown above.</li>
					</ol>

				<h2 class="crafts">Bird Cages</h2>
				<article>
					<p>Bird Cages are a very popular decorative item to incorporate in any party.</p>
				</article>
				<p>
					<img src="C:\Users\MYang\code\html-me-something\images\using-bird-cages-for-home-decor-beautiful-ideas-4-554x754.jpg"><br>
					This birdcage is beautifully decorated with pearls and flowers.  It adds a nice elegance to any baby shower or wedding deco&#769;r.
					The nice thing about bird cages is that you can decorate them in any way you&apos;d like.
					For instance, you can add butterflies and glitter, or soil and greenery.  Anything to match your specific party ideas.

				<h2 class="crafts">Balloons</h2>
				<p>
					<img src="C:\Users\MYang\code\html-me-something\images\BalloonBottle.jpg" height="650" width="400"><br>
					Balloons are great to work with in any craft project.
					They can be used in different projects to create anything you can dream of.
					As seen in the picture above, balloons were formed to create a bottle.
					This decoration was created for a friend's baby shower to indicate her little bundle of joy to come.

				<h2 class="crafts">Tablecloths</h2>
				<p>
					Tablecloths are a great item to use in party decorations.
					They can be manipulated to create anything you desire.
					You can use them during Halloween to create ghosts and spiders.
					They can be draped to ceilings and posts to create a dramatic effect.
					One of the main benefits to using tablecloths is that they are inexpensive yet effective.
